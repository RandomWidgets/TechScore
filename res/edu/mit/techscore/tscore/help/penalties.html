  <h1>Penalties</h1>
  <p><big>Enter individual penalties for one team in a given
  race.</big></p>
  <h2>New penalty</h2>
  <p>Enter penalties similarly to the way finishes are
  entered. Choose the race from the list and the type of
  penalty. Only five penalties types are provided consistent with
  college sailing rules. All penalties are scored Fleet + 1.</p>
  <p>If rotations are being used, you can opt to enter penalties by
  choosing the sail number instead of the team name.</p>
  <p>Choose the team from the drop down list (one at a time). The
  teams you can choose depend on which teams already have penalties
  in that race (no team can have more than one penalty).</p>
  <p>Optionally enter a brief commentary on the reasons for the
  penalty in the box labeled <em>Comment</em>. Click on the
  button <em>Enter penalty</em> to finish.</p>
  <h2>Current penalties</h2>
  <p>Under this section you will see the current penalties entered in
  the regatta. You may drop a penalty by clicking on
  the <em>Drop</em> button. The team will be reinstated to their
  original finish before the penalty and the regatta will be
  rescored.</p>
