  <h2>Options for <em>Type</em></h2>
  <p>The regatta type is included mostly for compatibility with other
  sailing programs as a way to organize different regattas. While the
  different options may alter the way the regatta title is displayed
  in some reports, <b>type has no effect on scoring</b>.</p>

  <h2>Options for <em>Scoring</em></h2>
  <p>There are two scoring types: <em>Standard</em>
  and <em>Combined</em>. As the name suggests, Standard scoring is
  the default in which each division races and is scored
  separately. In Combined scoring, or &quot;Combined divisions&quot;,
  the entire fleet (all the divisions) sails at the same time and are
  scored as one large division. Penalties and breakdowns occur out of
  the total fleet. Sailors can still be ranked within their own
  division.</p>

  <p>It is possible to switch from one type of scoring system to
  another midway through a regatta. However, if going from standard to
  combined scoring, bear in mind that you are likely to run into
  problems if using rotations, since in combined divisions all boats
  sail at once and thus each boat needs to be unique across the same
  race in all divisions. Also, because finishes are scored by
  simulated timestamp, a regatta that was scored as standard will
  likely need to be re-scored if switched to combined. These problems
  do not exist if switching from a regatta initially setup as combined
  scoring. At any rate, it is not customary to switch regatta scoring
  mechanisms half way through the regatta.</p>
