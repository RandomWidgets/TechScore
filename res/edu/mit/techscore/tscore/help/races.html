  <h1>Races & Teams</h1>
  <p><big>Setup the number of divisions and the number of races
  within each division. Setup the teams participating in the
  regatta.</big></p>

  <h2>Selecting divisions</h2>
  <p>
    In the top half of the screen, select the total number of
    divisions and races within each division. There are up to 26
    different divisions available (A-Z) and up to 50 races per
    division.
  </p>

  <h2>Entering and editing teams</h2>
  <p>
    A regatta requires at least two participating teams in order to
    proceed. To enter a new team, enter the name as indicated. There
    are two fields provided: <em>Full name</em> and <em>Nick
    name</em>. These two are provided for compatibility with other
    sailing programs (like college sailing) where each team is
    composed of a school name and a team mascot (to identify multiple
    squads from the same school). Only the <em>Full name</em> is
    required.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Hit Create to add the team.</b> Until you click on
    the <em>Create</em> button next to the team's nick name, the team
    will not be officially registered. As soon as that team is
    entered, a new blank field will be added to the list so that you
    may add another team. In addition, two new buttons will replace
    the <em>Create</em> button in the team just entered.
  </p>
  <p>The first of these buttons is used to edit the team
  names. Remember to click on this button if you wish to change the
  team name in order to save your changes.</p>
  <p>The second button removes the team from the regatta. Doing so
  will remove the team and all its associated data such as rotations
  and finishes. For this reason, TechScore will not allow you to
  enter or remove teams after the regatta is in progress.</p>
  <p class="tip">Use the <kbd>Tab</kbd> to advance
  fields. Press <kbd>Space</kbd> or <kbd>Enter</kbd> when you reach
  the button you wish to activate.</p>
