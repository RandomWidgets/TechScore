  <h1>Finishes</h1>
  <p><big>Enter or edit finishes for a specific race</big></p>
  <h2>Parameters</h2>
  <p>First choose the race for which you want to enter a finish. In
  case of combined division scoring, choose the race in any
  division. You can also use the spinner to cycle through the current
  races.</p>
  <p>If rotations have been setup, you can choose to enter finishes
  using sail numbers instead of team names. Choose the appropriate
  option from the <em>Using</em> drop down menu.</p>
  <h2>Teams &amp; Order</h2>
  <p>The main part of the pane consists of two lists,
  called <em>Teams</em> and <em>Order</em>.  Move the appropriate
  team or sail from the first list to another by clicking on each
  team at a time. If entering finishes using rotations, you can also
  enter the sail numbers directly in the textbox above the two lists
  and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> on your keyboard to move that sail
  over.</p>
  <p>Once on the second list, you can reshuffle the teams by clicking
  and dragging an item on the list. Clicking on the item in the
  second list will push it back to the first list.</p>
  <p>When all the teams have been moved to the second list, you will
  be able to click on the button in the bottom right
  labeled <em>Enter finish</em> to score that race. Only then will
  that race be officially added to the regatta. If you attempt to
  change races or leave the pane with partially entered finishes,
  TechScore will prompt you to enter or abandon those finishes.</p>
  <p>To remove finishes for an already scored race, click
  on the <em>Remove finish</em> button in the bottom left.</p>
  <p>To view the scores, go to <em>View</em>&gt;<em>View
  scores</em>.</p>
