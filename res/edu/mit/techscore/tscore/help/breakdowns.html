  <h1>Breakdowns</h1>
  <p><big>Enter individual breakdowns for one team in a given
  race.</big></p>
  <h2>New breakdown</h2>
  <p>Enter breakdowns similarly to the way finishes are
  entered. Choose the race from the list and the type of
  breakdown. Only three breakdown types are provided consistent with
  college sailing rules.</p>
  <p>Breakdowns can be scored as average score for that team in that
  division (<em>Average</em>) or as an assigned score at the
  discretion of the racing committee.</p>
  <p>If rotations are being used, you can opt to enter breakdowns by
  choosing the sail number instead of the team name. Just choose the
  appropriate option under the <em>Using</em>
  field. Unlike <strong>Penalties</strong>, you first have to choose
  the team. This is because depending on how the team finished,
  breakdowns might not be allowed. TechScore will warn accordingly if
  you choose an ineligible team (such as one already in first
  place).</p>
  <p>Choose to assign a score or average scoring in that division by
  entering the score in the textbox labeled <em>New score</em> for
  the former, or selecting the checkbox labeled <em>Average</em> for
  the latter.</p>
  <p>Optionally enter a brief commentary on the reasons for the
  breakdown in the box labeled <em>Comment</em>. Click on the
  button <em>Enter breakdown</em> to finish.</p>
  <h2>Current breakdowns</h2>
  <p>Under this section you will see the current breakdowns entered in
  the regatta. You may drop a breakdown by clicking on
  the <em>Drop</em> button. The team will be reinstated to their
  original finish before the breakdown and the regatta will be
  rescored.</p>
