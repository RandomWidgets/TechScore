  <h1>Setting up rotations</h1>
  <p><big>Optionally setup and remove rotations to be used throughout
  the regatta.</big></p>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Rotations can be used to enter finishes by using the sail numbers
  instead of the actual team names. They can be very complex in order
  to promote fairness. Each team is assigned a boat from a fixed set
  for each race in each division. If the scoring is combined, each
  team in each division will receive a unique boat in each race. This
  pane provides a number of parameters you can tweak to create
  virtually any rotation desired.</p>
  <h2>Parameters</h2>
  <p>Typically, rotations are created for sets of races at a time.
  With the parameters below, it is possible to create an entire
  rotation with just a few clicks, as TechScore takes care of
  shuffling the sail numbers for each race.</p>
  <h3>Rotation <em>Type</em></h3>
  <p>As a team's assigned sail shifts from one race to another, there
  are three ways to determine the next sail:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Standard (+1) assigns the next available sail from the
    set. If sails are numbered sequentially, this results in a team
    always moving to the boat with its current sail number plus
    1. When the last sail is reached, the next sail becomes the first
    in the list.</li>
    <li>Direct swap either moves the team into the next sail from the
    set or the previous one in such a way that every other team shifts
    in the same direction. <b>Direct swap requires an even number of
    teams in each race.</b></li>
    <li>With no rotation, each team sails the same boat in each
    race.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The shift from one sail to another happens after each race, with
  divisions kept separately in the process, but this can be controlled
  with the <em>Style</em> parameter.</p>
  <h3>Rotation <em>Style</em></h3>
  <p>When creating rotations for more than one division at a time (the
  standard procedure), it is customary to apply the rules of the
  rotation, as described above, for the same race number across all
  the divisions at a time. With the <em>Style</em> you can control at
  what point does the shift prescribed in the <em>Type</em> occur:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>With <em>Same for all divisions</em>, the shift happens after
    all the sails have been assigned for the same race number across
    all divisions. This style results in all divisions having the
    same rotation.</li>
    <li>With <em>Rotate sail at division switch</em>, the shift
    prescribed in the rotation type happens after every race,
    regardless of division. In college sailing, this is often
    referred to as <em>Navy special</em>.</li>
    <li>With <em>Start sails offset between divisions</em>, known
    colloquially as the Franny special, the chosen rotation type is
    applied to the first chosen division. After that, the same
    rotation type is copied over each other division in turn, with the
    starting sails shifted by the offset amount.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Races in set</h3>
  <p>It is often inconvenient to rotate after every race. This
  parameter allows you specifiy the number of races per set before
  rotating.  Thus, a value of <em>2</em> means that each team sails in
  the same sail for two races at a time before rotating according to
  the <em>type</em> and <em>style</em>.</p>
  <h3>(Offset) Amount</h3>
  <p>This option is only available if using the offset
  rotation <em>style</em> as discussed above. In that case, the
  amount to offset can be specified here. Note that the same offset
  will be applied to each division in turn. Thus, if there are
  divisions and the offset is 6, then the Division B's rotation will
  be offset 6 sails from Division A, while Division C's will be
  offset 12 from A.</p>
  <h3>Races</h3>
  <p>It is customary to apply the same rotation to the entire
  regatta. For convenience, you can specify a subset of races for
  which to apply the rotation style. This gives you the flexibility
  to apply a completely unique rotation style as you can tweak the
  races to be any set of race numbers, separated by commas. Ranges
  can be specified by using dashes, as shown.</p>
  <h3>Division order</h3>
  <p>While most rotations are applied to each division in alphabetical
  order, some race committees prefer to start rotations with a
  different division so as to end the regatta with the toughest
  division sailing last.</p>
  <p>To specify a different division order, drag the divisions around
  until the sequence reflects the desired order. This is particularly
  useful if using the second or third rotation style, as the first
  produces the same rotation for each division anyways, as discussed
  above under <em>Same for all divisions</em>.</p>
  <h3>Sort sails first</h3>
  <p>As of version 1.4, sails no longer have to be numbers, they can
  also include letters. Usually, however, the boats are arranged in
  order prior to creating the rotation. TechScore will attempt to
  order the sail values by their natural order, but if no ordering is
  required, the option is provided as well. This parameter tells
  TechScore to possibly sort the starting sails in the first race, so
  that if numbers are used, for example, the shift from one race to
  another is more logical.</p>
  <h2>Starting sails</h2>
  <p>Specify the sails to be used in the lower portion of the pane
  titled <em>Starting sails</em>. Each team in the regatta is printed
  with a textbox next to it. You may choose the next available sail by
  pressing the scroll buttons next to each textbox, or type your
  own. Note that you will not be allowed to click on <em>Set
  rotation</em> at the bottom-right of the screen if there are
  duplicate or missing sail numbers.</p>
  <p>Note also that these are the sail numbers in the first race in
  the first division (as specified by the division order).</p>
  <p>Finally, <strong>remember to click <em>Set rotation</em></strong>
  in the lower right corner to actually create the rotation! When you
  do, the Rotations dialog will open if not already open so that you
  can admire your work.</p>
  <h2>Removing a rotation</h2>
  <p>To remove a rotation, click on the <em>Delete</em> button in the
  lower left corner. You will be prompted to confirm if finished have
  been entered. Removing a rotation <b>does NOT affect the
  scores.</b></p>
